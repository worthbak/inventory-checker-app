### What is InventoryWatch?

InventoryWatch is an app for macOS that monitors local Apple Store inventory and notifies you when your preferred model comes in-stock. 

### Why do I need that? 

Ordering a new Apple product online can often involve monthslong shipping times and frustratingly vague delivery estimates. InventoryWatch is designed to help you jump the line: Apple Stores frequently (but irregularly) get fresh stock of hard-to-find products. When that happens, InventoryWatch will notify you immediately, so you can place an in-store pickup order and get your product in *minutes* instead of months. 

### What products does InventoryWatch support? 

InventoryWatch can monitor local stock for the following products: 

* M2 iPad Pro (11in and 13in) (**new**)
* iPad (10th Gen) (**new**)
* USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter (**new**)
* Apple Watch Ultra
* iPhone 14 Pro
* iPhone 14 Pro Max
* iPhone 14
* iPhone 14 Plus
* AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)
* M2 MacBook Air
* MacBook Pro (14" and 16")
* M2 MacBook Pro 13"
* Mac Studio
* Studio Display
* iPhone 13
* iPhone 13 mini
* iPad mini (wifi and cellular)

Note that not all build-to-order configurations will be stocked by Apple Stores (this is especially true for MacBook Pros). InventoryWatch only lists configurations that are known to be stocked by Apple Stores.
